				Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
				 documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.It can be assisted 
				by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting 
				languages such as JavaScript.
								Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local 
				storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.HTML 
				describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
				included cues for the appearance of the document. It is easy to use.

				CSS

			<p>
				Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
				describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language 
				like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and 
				content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can 
				improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in 
				the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web 
				pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
				.css file. CSS also saves time.

				JAVASCRIPT

			<p>
				JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
				 specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, 
				and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, 
				prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside
				 HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World 
				Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential 
				part of web applications. JavaScript is object based language as it 
				provides predefined objects.
